# Algorithm-Assignment4

This assignment contains writing algorithms and making descriptive videos for the algorithems which is accessible through this file,
and also this repository contais all the implemented algorithms:


1- Write an efficient program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum.

2- You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.

6--Write a function int equilibrium(int[] arr, int n); that given a sequence arr[] of size n, returns an equilibrium index (if any) or -1 if no equilibrium indexes exist.

7-Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader.

8-Given an array and a number k where k is smaller than size of array, we need to find the kâ€™th smallest element in the given array. It is given that ll array elements are distinct.

10-Print the elements of an array in the decreasing frequency if 2 numbers have same frequency then print the one which came first.
